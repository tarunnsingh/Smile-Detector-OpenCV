# Smile-Detector-OpenCV
### Overview
This project uses Haar Cascades to detect Smile (red box) on a human face. Alongside it also detects the face (blue box) and eyes (green boxes).
### Tuning
If the smile detector doesn't work well according to your requirements, you can tune the 'Accepted Neighbours' parameter in the SmileDetector.py file
which is currently set to 30 while creating the smiles array.
